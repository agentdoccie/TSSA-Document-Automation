üß† COPILOT PROJECT AUDIT PROMPT ‚Äì TSSA DOCUMENT AUTOMATION SYSTEM

Context:
This repository is a document automation system designed for TSSA. 
It must allow a user to fill one simple form (Google Form or HTML) that supplies 
data such as full name, address, ID, email, and date. That data must automatically 
populate about 12 preformatted DOCX templates, generate all of them fault-tolerantly, 
convert them to PDF, and merge them into one final downloadable file.

Goal:
We need a working, resilient MVP within days, not weeks. 
The current codebase includes multiple API endpoints (generate-document.js, 
generate-pdf.js, debug-template.js, selftest.js, etc.) and one core rendering module 
(lib/safeRenderDocx.js). Several recent changes were made with Copilot‚Äôs help, 
and we need a complete summary of what has been added, modified, or left incomplete.

Instructions for Copilot:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Review the entire repository context (all /api and /lib files, templates, vercel.json, package.json).
2Ô∏è‚É£ Produce a concise report that explains:
   ‚Ä¢ What major features or logic Copilot has added so far.
   ‚Ä¢ Which files or functions remain incomplete or error-prone.
   ‚Ä¢ What is required to reach a fully working system that can:
     - Render DOCX templates from data reliably (case-sensitive placeholders handled).
     - Convert those DOCX files to PDFs (with CloudConvert and local fallback).
     - Merge multiple PDFs into one final document.
     - Deliver the resulting PDF to the user and admin (download/email).
   ‚Ä¢ Identify any missing dependencies, mis-configured imports, or runtime incompatibilities with Vercel.
   ‚Ä¢ Suggest the minimal, most time-efficient path to a functioning, self-healing build (not an idealized 8-week refactor).

3Ô∏è‚É£ Explain:
   ‚Ä¢ Which modules or lines are redundant and can be safely removed.
   ‚Ä¢ Which features are essential for stability (e.g., retries, /tmp handling, error logging).
   ‚Ä¢ How to finalize placeholder mapping for all templates.

Output format:
üëâ Provide a structured summary with sections:
   - Summary of current state
   - Issues detected
   - Essential next steps (priority 1-3)
   - Optional improvements (can wait until after launch)

Focus on getting a working prototype that runs on Vercel with Node18, minimal configuration, 
and zero dependency on external manual intervention.

End of prompt.
